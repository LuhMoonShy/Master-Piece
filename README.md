# ☠ Master Piece ☠
🚤 This web site was created by me and two other colleagues during our first front-end related class in college. </br>
👹 The main objective of this page is to explain about the One Piece anime, 
both with content for those who already watch the anime and for those who are curious about it and want to start watching. </br>
🏝The content is not finalized, but you can still check the result.
